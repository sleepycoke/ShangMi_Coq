This project aims to formalize SM(商密)2, 3, 4 Algorithms in Coq. 
However, only prime field cases are finished. 
You may refer to ./Docs for the standards. 

These codes are tested under Coq version 8.14.0

This project was developed while I was a graduate student in Computer Science Department of Nanjing University.
